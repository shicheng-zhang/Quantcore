"""Shared application state.

Singletons are created in `init_state()` (called from the FastAPI lifespan,
which runs in the worker process only — this preserves the Uvicorn-reloader
DuckDB-lock safety that paper_broker/analytics already relied on).

Routers MUST access these as attributes (`state.analytics`), NEVER via
`from .state import analytics` — the latter binds the value at import time,
when it is still None. Attribute access resolves at call time, after init.
